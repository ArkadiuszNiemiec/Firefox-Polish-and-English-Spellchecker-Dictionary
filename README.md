# Firefox-Polish-and-English-Spellchecker-Dictionary

This is a Polish Spellchecker Dictionary from https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/polish-spellchecker-dictionary/ combined with English US Dictionary from https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/us-english-dictionary/
It is created so you can type in both languages without changing any settings (currently the Firefox does not support multiple dictionaries).

To use paste included `.xpi` file to `extensions` dir in your Firefox profile dir. On windows it's:
```
C:\Users\user\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\*.default\extensions
```
and select it under right-click menu (while typing).

Alternatively you can use it by building your own extension or replacing `.dic` and `.aff` files in existing one.
